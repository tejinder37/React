Props => properties. 

a(fsdfsdf);
<a name="harjeet"/>
<a></a>

<!-- const a = ({name})=>{   // component if not is small  if long component then we call it page. it has object name props.
name
} -->
const a = (props)=>{   // component if not is small  if long component then we call it page. it has object name {props.name}
}

props can take any type of data. we can send props parent to child.


This ui tree helps react to keep track of the relationship of the components.

mainly react has two types of tree

1. render tree. => it consists of components that are rendered in a parent child relationship.
2. module dependency tree.It consists of depenedencies required by those components.
